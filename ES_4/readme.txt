Note:
    +/ The file tests.dat contains test-data for 4.1, do not touch
    it. It must be in the same folder as least-squares.py.
    +/ You need to fill in a few things to make the test files
    executable. Figure it out :-)

For 4.1, use least-squares.py. Use beta = 0.5 and gamma = 1e-2 for
your armijo function.

For 4.2, use newton.py
